## What is ep_rev_transcription?
An Etherpad Plugin to apply the ep_rev_transcription functionality in a pad. (describe in minimum 50 Letters what it is)
Currently supports:
* ep_rev_transcription functionality 1
* ep_rev_transcription functionality 2
* ep_rev_transcription functionality 3
* ep_rev_transcription functionality 4
## ep_rev_transcription Usage
Experimental.  As a special attribute on Etherpad, some weirdness may be experienced by using ep_rev_transcription.
## ep_rev_transcription History
I decided to copy/paste the ep_t3 over ep_rev_transcription to create that plugin.
